This project features a basic chatbot implemented in Python using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The chatbot engages in a text-based conversation with the user through a simple GUI. Although there might be a slight delay during the initial load due to the model being loaded into memory, once loaded, the chatbot is quite responsive and provides a delightful text-generation based interaction.
